Code Review

Thread Safety
Not documented in javadocs thoroughly. Mentions in line 9-10 of StopWatchCreator, but I think it should be expanded for individual methods.

StopWatchCreator
line 43
It would be helpful for the javadoc to explain what the start function does apart from throwing an illegal argument exception in the case of an already running stopwatch.
line 79
Again, would be helpful to have a javadoc description here.

Line 89
I think the reset is supposed to actually stop the stopwatch if it’s already running and your program does clear the lap times as well as change the running state to false, but it doesn’t add the past times or add the lap times, like the stop function does. Maybe this is your intention, but it’s a bit confusing to say that the stopwatch stops if it’s already running. There’s also no condition to check if the stopwatch is already running.

Line 105
Warnings shouldn’t be suppressed.

Line 106
Should describe what happens with the lap times when the function is called while the stopwatch is still running. It seems to just add however long the stopwatch has been started and count it as a lap, but I think it should only be a lap if the stopwatch is stopped. It also doesn’t seem to give any of the possible previous lap times. I think if it’s called while the stopwatch is running, it should just gives the list of recorded lap times up until this point.

118
Effective Java recommends using string builder.
Also lap times is an array list here so you might want some way to differentiate between the different times.

114
Unnecessary to have a cloned copy of the lapTimes list. 

Line 122
Having an overridden equals method is unnecessary code. There’s not a reason to compare two stopwatches and it will likely just cause more confusion.

StopWatchFactory

Lines 16-17
I think this should be in the javadoc instead of a comment.

Line 19
I’ve never seen CopyOnWriteWriteArrayList before, but from brief reading online, it seems like it’s not efficient and not ideal for modifying an array. Documentation mentions that it’s good if iterating, but won’t update changes if you’re modifying the list, which seems less effective since we are modifying the list of stopwatches and rarely iterating through it.

Line 24
Javadocs param should give type

Line 35-36
This seems more appropriate for javadoc

Extra ending space

All error messages are missing descriptive error descriptions. Add these.
For example “Error: Stopwatch cannot record lap because it is not running”.
