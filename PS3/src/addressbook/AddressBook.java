/**
 * This package provides a simple API for an Address Book.
 * An Address Book is a collection of Contacts. Each contact consists
 * of at least one of the following: name, email address, phone number,
 * address, or a note about the contact. 
 * 
 * AddressBooks can be saved to a file by invoked a.save(filePath) on
 * an AddressBook, and can be loaded by providing the filepath of a previously
 * saved AddressBook to a constructor.
 * 
 * There is minimal checking involved with the elements of a contact.
 * A user could input an emoji as a name or question marks as a phone number,
 * and there will be no exceptions throw. It is up to the user or application
 * to check these values. The iOS contacts application is presented in a similar
 * way.
 * 
 * Inputs the Address as a string and may not be suited for applications that
 * rely on a well formed address of Street1, Street2, City, State, Zip, Country, etc.
